Al-Powered Personalized Learning Path Generator {PROGATH- The Smart Path}

AIM utilize generative ai to craft learning paths for Students.

eliminates the Paradox of choice

identifies and target the strengths and weaknesses of a learner and provide a customiZed path.

Provides quality level education / learning guidance regardless of their location or background .

DESCRIPTION What will I make? - A simple website where a student or user types in any topic they want to learn(eg- web development, accounting etc)

Instead of showing thousands of random videos the site will show a clear week based plans into small daily tasks.

Why is there a need for this? - Too Much Choice: When a student tries to search "Learn Python" on Google, he/she gets millions of results. Most students get confused and give up before they even start. This site picks the path for them.

Fear of Starting: Many beginners feel "blank" when starting a new subject. Having a pre-made list of steps removes that fear and gives them confidence.

Lack of Structure: Most people try to learn everything at once. This tool provides a logical order(Learning the ABCs before writing a novel).

APPROACH

Single-Platform Development: I will be using Next.js as my primary framework because it handles both the website design and the background logic in one place.

UI Design: To save time on styling,I will use Tailwind CSS and pre-made components, allowing me to create a professional-looking interface in a limited time.

AI Integration: The website will connect to a standard Generative AI API to instantly turn a user's topic into a structured few weeks learning plan.

TOOLS THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE MAKING OF THIS PROJECT

— Next.js: Acting as both the frontend (what users see) and the backend (the logic).

—Tailwind CSS: To style the website quickly.

— Shadcn UI: provides pre-made professional components.

— Google Gemini: provide the structured learning steps.

— Cursor: primary code editor.

— Vercel: To host the website online.
